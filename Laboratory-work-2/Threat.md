| 13| Browser-Web-App-Request  | An adversary can steal sensitive data like user credentials | Spoofing | Attackers can exploit weaknesses in system to steal user credentials. Downstream and upstream components are often accessed by using credentials stored in configuration stores. Attackers may steal the upstream or downstream component credentials. Attackers may steal credentials if, Credentials are stored and sent in clear text, Weak input validation coupled with dynamic sql queries, Password retrieval mechanism are poor,   |
| 14| Browser-Web-App-Request  | Attackers can steal user session cookies due to insecure cookie attributes | Spoofing | The session cookies is the identifier by which the server knows the identity of current user for each incoming request.

| 15| Browser-Web-App-Request  | An adversary can create a fake website and launch phishing attacks | Spoofing | Phishing is attempted to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and sometimes, indirectly, money), often for malicious reasons, by masquerading as a Web Server which is a trustworthy entity in electronic communication |
| 16| Browser-Web-App-Request  | An adversary may spoof Browser and gain access to Web Application | Spoofing | If proper authentication is not in place, an adversary can spoof a source process or external entity and gain unauthorized access to the Web Application |
| 17| Browser-Web-App-Request  | An adversary can deface the target web application by injecting malicious code or uploading dangerous files | Tampering | Website defacement is an attack on a website where the attacker changes the visual appearance of the site or a webpage.  |
| 18| Browser-Web-App-Request  | An attacker steals messages off the network and replays them in order to steal a user's session | Tampering | An attacker steals messages off the network and replays them in order to steal a user's session |
| 19| Browser-Web-App-Request  | An adversary can gain access to sensitive data by performing SQL injection through Web App | Tampering | SQL injection is an attack in which malicious code is inserted into strings that are later passed to an instance of SQL Server for parsing and execution. The primary form of SQL injection consists of direct insertion of code into user-input variables that are concatenated with SQL commands and executed. A less direct attack injects malicious code into strings that are destined for storage in a table or as metadata. When the stored strings are subsequently concatenated into a dynamic SQL command, the malicious code is executed.  |
