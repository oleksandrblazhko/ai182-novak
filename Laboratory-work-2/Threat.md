| Id | Category | Title | Description |
|:-----------|:---------:|:-----------:|:---------:|
| 0 | Denial of Service | An adversary can perform action on behalf of other user due to lack of controls against cross domain requests | Failure to restrict requests originating from third party domains may result in unauthorized actions or access of data |
| 1 | Elevation of Privileges | An adversary may bypass critical steps or perform actions on behalf of other users (victims) due to improper validation logic | Failure to restrict the privileges and access rights to the application to individuals who require the privileges or access rights may result into unauthorized use of data due to inappropriate rights settings and validation. |
| 2 | Information Disclosure | An adversary can reverse weakly encrypted or hashed content | An adversary can reverse weakly encrypted or hashed content |
| 3 | Information Disclosure | An adversary may gain access to sensitive data from log files | An adversary may gain access to sensitive data from log files |
| 4 | Information Disclosure | An adversary may gain access to unmasked sensitive data such as credit card numbers | An adversary may gain access to unmasked sensitive data such as credit card numbers |
| 5 | Information Disclosure | An adversary can gain access to certain pages or the site as a whole. | Robots.txt is often found in your site's root directory and exists to regulate the bots that crawl your site. This is where you can grant or deny permission to all or some specific search engine robots to access certain pages or your site as a whole. The standard for this file was developed in 1994 and is known as the Robots Exclusion Standard or Robots Exclusion Protocol. Detailed info about the robots.txt protocol can be found at robotstxt.org. |
| 6 | Information Disclosure | An adversary can gain access to sensitive data by sniffing traffic to Web Application | An adversary may conduct man in the middle attack and downgrade TLS connection to clear text protocol, or forcing browser communication to pass through a proxy server that he controls. This may happen because the application may use mixed content or HTTP Strict Transport Security policy is not ensured. |
| 7 | Information Disclosure | An adversary can gain access to sensitive information through error messages | An adversary can gain access to sensitive data such as the following, through verbose error messages - Server names  - Connection strings  - Usernames  - Passwords  - SQL procedures  - Details of dynamic SQL failures  - Stack trace and lines of code  - Variables stored in memory  - Drive and folder locations  - Application install points  - Host configuration settings  - Other internal application details  |
| 8 | Information Disclosure | An adversary may gain access to sensitive data from uncleared browser cache | An adversary may gain access to sensitive data from uncleared browser cache |
| 9 | Repudiation | Attacker can deny the malicious act and remove the attack foot prints leading to repudiation issues | Proper logging of all security events and user actions builds traceability in a system and denies any possible repudiation issues. In the absence of proper auditing and logging controls, it would become impossible to implement any accountability in a system |
| 10 | Spoofing | An adversary can get access to a user's session due to improper logout and timeout | The session cookies is the identifier by which the server knows the identity of current user for each incoming request. If the attacker is able to steal the user token he would be able to access all user data and perform all actions on behalf of user. |
| 11 | Spoofing | An adversary can get access to a user's session due to insecure coding practices | The session cookies is the identifier by which the server knows the identity of current user for each incoming request. If the attacker is able to steal the user token he would be able to access all user data and perform all actions on behalf of user. |
| 12 | Spoofing | An adversary can spoof the target web application due to insecure TLS certificate configuration | Ensure that TLS certificate parameters are configured with correct values |
| 13 | Spoofing | An adversary can steal sensitive data like user credentials | Attackers can exploit weaknesses in system to steal user credentials. Downstream and upstream components are often accessed by using credentials stored in configuration stores. Attackers may steal the upstream or downstream component credentials. Attackers may steal credentials if, Credentials are stored and sent in clear text, Weak input validation coupled with dynamic sql queries, Password retrieval mechanism are poor,   |
| 14 | Spoofing | Attackers can steal user session cookies due to insecure cookie attributes | The session cookies is the identifier by which the server knows the identity of current user for each incoming request. If the attacker is able to steal the user token he would be able to access all user data and perform all actions on behalf of user.  |
| 15 | Spoofing | An adversary can create a fake website and launch phishing attacks | Phishing is attempted to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and sometimes, indirectly, money), often for malicious reasons, by masquerading as a Web Server which is a trustworthy entity in electronic communication |
| 16 | Spoofing | An adversary may spoof Browser and gain access to Web Application | If proper authentication is not in place, an adversary can spoof a source process or external entity and gain unauthorized access to the Web Application |
| 17 | Tampering | An adversary can deface the target web application by injecting malicious code or uploading dangerous files | Website defacement is an attack on a website where the attacker changes the visual appearance of the site or a webpage.  |
| 18 | Tampering | An attacker steals messages off the network and replays them in order to steal a user's session | An attacker steals messages off the network and replays them in order to steal a user's session |
| 19 | Tampering | An adversary can gain access to sensitive data by performing SQL injection through Web App | SQL injection is an attack in which malicious code is inserted into strings that are later passed to an instance of SQL Server for parsing and execution. The primary form of SQL injection consists of direct insertion of code into user-input variables that are concatenated with SQL commands and executed. A less direct attack injects malicious code into strings that are destined for storage in a table or as metadata. When the stored strings are subsequently concatenated into a dynamic SQL command, the malicious code is executed.  |
